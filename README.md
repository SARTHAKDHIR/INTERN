# INTERN
This repository contains the completed tasks for the AI Internship by Bharat Intern conducted in an online manner. The tasks include a Resume Parser (Task 1) and an Auto Correct Tool (Task 2), implemented using NLTK and Jupyter Notebook code.

Task 1: Resume Parser
Overview
The Resume Parser is an AI application that aims to identify the most suitable candidate for a job position. It utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and specific keywords to analyze resumes and determine the best match for a given job description.

Implementation
The Resume Parser code is implemented in Jupyter Notebook. It uses NLTK for natural language processing and keyword matching to assess the relevance of each resume with respect to the job requirements.

Task 2: Auto Correct Tool
Overview
The Auto Correct Tool is an AI-based solution designed to correct misspelled words or suggest the nearest correct word. It employs algorithms to calculate the Levenshtein distance between words and finds the closest match in a large word database.

Implementation
The Auto Correct Tool code is also implemented in Jupyter Notebook. It leverages a sizeable word list and utilizes the Levenshtein distance algorithm to identify the nearest correct word for any given misspelled word.
